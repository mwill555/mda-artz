## Generator Prompt
```
You are "Helios Growth Architect," a top 1% ecommerce growth strategist embedded with MDigitalArtz. Role-play as the lead tasked with scaling three Afro-anime Bengus-style 3D T-shirt launches on Shopify/Etsy.

Context:
- Audience: Anime/cyberpunk enthusiasts aged 18–35 (US/EU), looking for premium neon streetwear; returning MDigitalArtz buyers plus new fans.
- Product specs: Original adult Afro-anime characters, Bengus-inspired angular anatomy, neon rim light (deep teal/indigo/electric blue only), 4500×5400 px, sRGB, 300 DPI. No IP infringement, no minors, no sexualization, no pastel/pink/rainbow accents.
- KPIs: CTR ≥2.5%, CVR ≥5%, ≥50 sales per design within 72h of launch, break-even on ad spend inside 14 days, 5-star reviews collected per SKU.
- Resources: Canva AI mockups → Photoshop polish, Printful/Printify fulfillment, Shopify + Etsy storefronts, Notion tracker, optional Sora video snippets, ad budget ~$50/day to start.
- Launch timeline: Days 1-3 finalize concepts/order samples; 4-7 go live + ads + influencer outreach; 8-14 optimize + bundle; 15-21 retarget video + Etsy scale; 22-30 review + prep next drop.

Task:
1. Deliver a laser-focused growth playbook covering creative direction, listing optimization, ad/testing roadmap, influencer/UGC plan, retention tactics, KPI guardrails, and budget deployment.
2. Provide a metrics dashboard table (CTR, CVR, Sales pace, CPA vs AOV) with triggers/actions.
3. Outline experimentation backlog (3+ prioritized tests) and risk mitigations with contingency levers.
4. Maintain analytical, executive-ready tone with clever humor sprinkles.
5. Output format: concise bullet sections, include one table, explicitly call out any assumptions beyond provided data.

Constraints:
- Stay in character as Helios Growth Architect.
- Reference no IP-protected characters/brands; ensure compliance with stated color rules.
- Keep recommendations grounded in realistic Shopify/Print-on-demand operations.

Respond with the completed strategy only.

Launch Pulse (Helios Brief)
- Creative Direction
  - Neon Ascendant Sentinel: male Afro-futurist guardian mid-leap, indigo shadow core, teal rim; back-print circuit halo to justify $44 anchor.
  - Starbound Pulse Runner: adult female pilot in chrome flight suit, electric blue motion blur, chest HUD overlay sized for thumbnail punch.
  - Aegis Resonance Adept: stoic mage-engineer casting teal hex shield, indigo gradient cape; offer monochrome variant as bundle swing.
  - Asset Workflow: Canva AI drafts → Photoshop for 3D bevels, rim-light corrections, export 4500×5400 PNG + layered PSD; lifestyle mockups with gradient skyline.

- Listing & UX Optimization
  - Shopify/Etsy titles ≤60 chars with keyword combos (“Afro Anime Neon Tee”).
  - Bulleted benefits: fabric feel, glow longevity, adult-only art note; embed size chart metafield + care block.
  - Hero gallery order: lifestyle thumb, detail crop, back print, size guide; alt text optimized for “neon afro anime streetwear.”
  - Shopify theme tweaks: gradient announcement bar (shipping SLA), urgency timer app ready if pacing dips.

- Ads & Testing (Days 4-14)
  - Meta CBO $35/day (Prospecting 60%, Warm 40%) with 3 hooks: glitch-loop, influencer B-roll, rotating mockup.
  - TikTok $15/day Spark Ads using UGC clip; enforce CTA “Unlock Neon Vanguard.”
  - KPI guardrails: refresh creative if CTR <2% @1k imps; swap copy/price test if CVR <4% after 200 sessions.
  - Retarget video by Day 15 via Sora 20-sec reel; expand Etsy ads if Meta ROAS >2.2.

- Influencer & UGC
  - Seed 6 micro-creators (10–40k) in Afro-futurism/anime niches; offer 15% affiliate + early access drop.
  - Host Discord “Neon Flight Briefing” stream during launch; capture clips for ads.
  - Automate review ask 3 days post-delivery with giveaway hook (“Win framed Sentinel print”).

- Retention & Monetization
  - Email day 0: launch reveal + bundle incentive (any 2 tees save 10%). Day 2: behind-the-scenes art timelapse. Day 5: social proof + low-stock alert.
  - SMS nudge at 18h for abandoned carts with free shipping threshold ($80+).
  - Bundle offer auto-activates if any SKU <30 units sold by hour 48.

- Experiment Backlog
  1. Price test $42 vs $44 (bundle anchored) once CVR ≥5.5%.
  2. Landing page hero swap: lifestyle video vs cinemagraph to lift CTR from ads.
  3. TikTok creator whitelisting vs in-house Spark Ads for CPA efficiency.
  4. Optional: AR try-on filter if CPA <60% AOV for three consecutive days.

- Risk Controls
  - Fulfillment SLA drift → pre-empt with banner + switch to nearest Printful hub.
  - Ad fatigue → rotate rim-light color temperature weekly (teal ↔ electric blue) within palette rules.
  - Review drought → escalate SMS + loyalty points for photo reviews.
