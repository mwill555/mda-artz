## 💡 Quick Implementation Tips

- **Start small**: Pick 2-3 tasks from High Priority section this week
- **Track progress**: Use this document as checklist, check off completed items
- **Measure impact**: Before/after comparison for each change
- **Iterate quickly**: Test, learn, adjust within 3-7 day sprints

- **Use existing tools**: Leverage Shopify App Store before building custom solutions

## 🚨 Risk Controls & Contingencies

- **Fulfillment SLA drift** → Pre-empt with banner + switch to nearest Printful hub
- **Ad fatigue** → Rotate creative elements weekly (color temperature, angles, hooks)
- **Review drought** → Escalate SMS + loyalty points for photo reviews
- **Cash flow crunch** → Reduce ad spend by 50% until margins improve
- **Low conversion rate** → Run urgency timer test (24h flash sale)
- **High cart abandonment** → Test free shipping threshold adjustment

**Remember**: Focus on tasks that move key metrics (traffic, conversion rate, average order value, customer lifetime value). Start with quick wins that don't require large investment, then scale what works.
